  # Saving our Planet
 
  What happened? This is a more realistic picture of the state of our planet. Our human activities put a strain on the environment. Modern transportation, especially airplanes and container ships contribute to global warming. We exploit more and more resources, cutting down trees and destroying the living spaces of animals. We consume ever more products that are manufactured by industrial factories polluting the air and producing lots of waste.
 
  __We need to act now!__
 
  It can't go on like this. Clean up the planet and support the usage of renewable energies.
 
  ## Instructions
 
  - Tap on __Bottles__ in the water and __Trash Piles__ on land to clean them up!
  - Clean up __Oil Spills__ as quickly as possible!
  - Look out for silhouettes of __Wind Turbines__ and tap them!
  - Don't tap on the __Birds__, they are an endangered species!
  - Clean up the planet and build at least __5 Wind Turbines__!

  You can start over by pressing __Run My Code__.
 
  _Hint:_ Rotate your iPad to landscape orientation and drag the border between the editor and the world map to the left to see it in _full-screen mode_.
 
 
  After saving the planet, you can go on to the [next page](@next) to do some experimentation.
